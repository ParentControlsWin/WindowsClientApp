## Software

This is the PCW Windows Client app, currently on version 1.0.5 and licensed under GPL-3.

You can view an [install guide here](https://www.parentcontrols.win/install_pcw), and you can download the installer through the link as well after setting up an account.

I usually work on the app through Visual Studios and I build the installer using the available inno script. If you have any questions, don't be afraid to email me through our [contact page](https://www.parentcontrols.win/contact) (don't worry, we're a small company, an engineer will see it). Do let us know if you try to build something or if you encounter issues!
